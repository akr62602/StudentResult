**Project Name:** Student Result Management System

**Description:**

This Java-based web application provides a comprehensive system for managing student results. It utilizes servlets, JSP (if applicable), MySQL database, Apache Tomcat server, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a user-friendly and efficient solution.

**Key Features:**

- **Student Management:**
    - Add new students with relevant details.
    - Update or delete existing student information (optional, based on your implementation).
- **Marks Management:**
    - Enter marks for students in various subjects.
    - Edit or delete entered marks (optional).
- **Result Access:**
    - Search for student results by roll number.
    - View detailed results in a user-friendly format.
- **Report Generation:**
    - Generate PDF reports containing student results (optional, based on your implementation).

**Technologies Used:**

- Java (Back-end)
- Servlets (and/or JSP) (Back-end)
- MySQL (Database)
- Apache Tomcat (Web Server)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Front-end)

**Prerequisites:**

- Java Development Kit (JDK) ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
- Apache Tomcat Server ([https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi))
- MySQL Database Server ([https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/))
- NetBeans IDE 8.2 (or a suitable IDE) ([https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/))

**Installation:**

1. **Download and install** the required software (JDK, Tomcat, MySQL).
2. **Create a MySQL database** for storing student results.
3. **Clone this repository** using Git: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Student-Result-Management-System.git`
4. **Import the project** into NetBeans IDE (or your chosen IDE).
5. **Configure database connection details** in the project's code (refer to specific code instructions).

**Usage:**

1. **Start Apache Tomcat** server.
2. **Deploy the application** to Tomcat (instructions may vary depending on IDE).
3. **Access the application** in your web browser using the deployed URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/your-application-name`).
4. **Use the provided interface** to manage student data, enter marks, search for results, and potentially generate reports (if implemented).

**Folder Structure (Example):**

- src/main/java (Java source code for servlets, models, etc.)
- src/main/webapp (JSP files, web content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- WEB-INF (Deployment descriptor (web.xml), additional configuration files)
- resources (Database connection properties or other configuration files)

**Development Notes:**

- This README provides a general overview. Refer to the project's code for specific implementation details.
- Adapt database schema and queries to your specific needs.
- Consider security measures (e.g., user authentication) for a production environment.

**Disclaimer:**
